        <h3>About Ari</h3>

        <p>I love any excuse to be creative, even if only in my mind. One such thing I love, when my mind allows me, is imagining the dream home I've only fantasized about since I was 19: Decorating and redecorating rooms according to the changing seasons, elaborately prepared gatherings with gourmet meals, planting herbs and flowers in the gardens, playing the ebony grand Steinway, going through secret passages to secret rooms and escape routes, morning walks through the sun-filtered redwoods, drives in a Karmann Ghia convertible through a purple-flowered tunnel, swimming through a koi-pond plexi-tunnel into a secret wine cave, watching whales migrate by against the sunset, and getting lulled to sleep by the sound of the rolling ocean.</p>
        <p>Another creative mental exercise I love is planning our next bucket list travel destination: the cool, fun things to do, local foods to eat, top places to see, cultural needs-to-know, including handy key phrases.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, I can get pretty obsessed when it comes to planning for anything, actually. It feels like a painful mental sickness. Often unable to sleep, because I live and relive an event or trip many times before it's even happenend: trying to find snags, updating logistics, trying to solve potential problems with backup plans. Needless to say, I'm relieved when it all comes to fruition.</p>
        <p>In a previous life, I was a perennial administrative assistant across different industries, taking care of engineers, more engineers, underwriters, lawyers, more engineers, upper management, clients, and outside sales reps. You may even accuse me of enjoying people.</p>
        <p>In the past, I have oftentimes been picked to be in the jury box. I was once told the lawyers unanimously voted me the friendliest face in the jurybox. Now I know better. For this same reason, I probably found myself "volunteered" to be on the company safety team.</p>
        <p>Currently, aside from trying to keep up with the latest and greatest trends of tools and tech to build beautiful, responsive websites alongside my partner/husband, I lead a double-life as his Facebook secretary, nutritionist, dream analyzer, navigator, masseuse, jam buddy, card game opponent and muse, all usually occurring during breaks in between websites. I aspire to play the ukelele and be a really, super-badass code ninja.</p>
        <p>I may need help on being an incessant list-taker, over-thinker, planner. And though in the past, I've been accused of being psychic, it was actually because I Googled all the time, (a remnant habit of when I was finding people for recruiting purposes). I find it a relief that now it is a requirement of my profession.</p>
