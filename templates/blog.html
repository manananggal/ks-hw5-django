            <h6>Creating a Personal Website in Bootstrap4</h6>
            <p>Since I had the basics in CSS, or so I thought, I figured it should've been somewhat easy to use Bootstrap 4. Well, it was, and it wasn't.</p>
            <p>I soon realized I didn't know anywhere near enough CSS nor did I remember even half the things I learned online a year ago. (Use it or lose it, folks.)</p>
            <p>I really loved I was able to create a super basic site in a relatively short amount of time. In this, Bootstrap 4 is a blessing of efficiency. These guys have so many things figured out already. Thanks, Bootstrap!</p>
            <p>One could choose to go with a ready-made theme or with a customizable, blank-slate-type basic template, for which, one could just pick/choose ready-made functionality from a gallery according to your purposes.</p>
            <p>I chose the customizable, blank-slate-type basic template since I didn't want to have to strip out a bunch of stuff I wouldn't use. (Even so with the stripped-down version, I still stripped a bunch of stuff out.)</p>
            <p>Like I said, I just wanted something simple and basic.</p>
            <p>Soon after quickly sketching out what I envisioned in my head, I picked out my header and body fonts; selected a simple nav from the Bootstrap gallery; and chose a simple-looking, responsive grid layout I could use for both my projects and blog pages.</p>
            <p>From there, once I knew exactly which assets I wanted, I obtained and resized my pics to be suitable for the web using PhotoShop. Slapped in a little background texture. Then, though simple and basic, I had something within a day.</p>
            <p>For the future, I have the freedom to add more pages, functionality, and change the look and feel in any way I want according to any future whims or needs!</p>

            <h6>Newbie Frustrations in Coding Land: Currently CSS</h6>
            <p>I've learned a few things with dealing with coding as I was specifically working on CSS so far:</p>
            <p>#1: O.M.G. -- What the heck is overriding my added CSS code!!?? Inspect element, and box model in inspect element is your friend.</p>
            <p>#2: What the -- Why the heck is it overriding my added CSS??!! Easy. Go here: <a href="https://specificity.keegan.st" target="_blank">https://specificity.keegan.st</a>.</p>
            <p>#3: It pays to save changes and reload your webpage after each change. Or if you're lazy, I suppose you could choose to use browser sync to save yourself some save-reload trouble.</p>
            <p>#4: Take. Breaks. Regularly. Your mind, body and spirit will thank you. Give your mind a second to digest what it has to solve. Meanwhile...</p>
            <p>Take care of your body: Drink some water, eat something that DOESN'T give you food coma, do some sit-ups, push-ups, or walk around the block and get some fresh air.</p>
            <p>Get your Zen on: Do some yoga or meditation</p>
            <p>Get your Mastermind on: vent, collaborate, lighten up and crack some jokes, or if you're anti-social, listen to some music.</p>
            <p>-- Point is: to take a quick break, reset, reframe, then come back to your problem refreshed.</p>
            <p>Many times, you think of or find the solution, or rephrase your question to the All-Knowing Google and VOILA!, or are told the solution by some angel throwing their voice in a nearby cubicle, or however which way the solution came to you.</p>
            <p>In the very least, CSS or otherwise, it'll make things more bearable and you'll be able to move onward and upward to bigger, better, more towards building your best web app ever!</p>
            <p>...By the way, just a "Thank you" to the voice-throwing angel in the cubicle nearby...</p>
